# REST
[A full discussion of RESTful interfaces](http://www.restapitutorial.com/lessons/whatisrest.html) is beyond the scope of this lesson, but at a rough approximation adding REST interfaces allows us to communicate with the ESP8266 using simple HTTP requests which you can enter in a web browser.

### Projects
#### [RESTserver](RESTserver/RESTserver.ino)
This sketch demonstrates the use of REST commands to GET information from the device, to send commands to the device, and to send commands to other devices.  The sketch utilizes a simple REST HTTP server which you can customize to provide your own interfaces and controls, and provides a simple web page to explore the capabilities provided.
