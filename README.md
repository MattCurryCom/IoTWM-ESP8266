# IoTWM ESP8266
###### Getting started with Arduino and the ESP8266 for IoT development

This presentation will require the use of some simple free tools on your computer.  Download and install the items listed below before the presentation so you'll be ready to hack once we get started.

### Requirements
- A Windows, OSX, or Linux computer with an available USB port
- A micro-USB cable
- An ESP8266 development board (I'll be providing this part)

### Install the Arduino IDE
Download the Arduino IDE for your operating system and install with the instructions linked below

- [Download link](http://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software)
- [Installation instructions](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage)

### Configure the ESP8266 Board Manager
Once the Arduino IDE is available we can add support for the development boards we'll be using.

1. Launch the Arduino application
2. Select the "File" menu, then "Preferences"
3. In the box labeled "Additional Boards Manager URLs" paste the following URL: `http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json`
