# ESP8266 for IoT
# Introduction
This series of tutorials will cover several approaches to utilizing the ESP8266 platform for IoT device development and experimentation.  Each tutorial stands alone and can be used as a starting point for your own projects.

# Tutorials
### [01_Blink](../01_Blink)
The "hello world" of the embedded world, we'll start with the simplest sketch possible and blink some LEDs.  Learn how to upload and run programs on the ESP8266.

### [02_WiFi_and_REST](../02_WiFi_and_REST)
Connect the ESP8266 to wireless and send commands to the device via REST.  Uses the [aREST library](https://github.com/marcoschwartz/aREST) for Arduino and ESP8266.

### [03_MQTT](../03_MQTT)
Publish and subscribe to topics on a public MQTT broker.  This tutorial relies on a cloud-based, public, and completely insecure broker for demo purposes.

### [04_Blynk](../04_Blynk)
Connect your device to the cloud and create a mobile app interface to control it from an Android or IOS device.
